# Google Search Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The Google search was returning HTML content in the "error" field instead of properly extracted summaries. This was happening because:

1. The web scraping logic in `services/web_service.py` (line 263) was checking if the fetched HTML content contained the word "error" (case-insensitive)
2. Many legitimate web pages contain the word "error" in their HTML (for JavaScript error handling, error messages, etc.)
3. When "error" was found, the entire HTML document was treated as an error and placed in the error field

## The Fix Applied
I've modified the error detection logic in both:
- `services/web_service.py` (line 263)
- `aws-deployment/src/services/web_service.py` (line 263)

### Before:
```python
elif isinstance(result, str) and 'Timeout error' not in result and 'error' not in result.lower():
    # Process HTML content
```

### After:
```python
elif isinstance(result, str) and not result.startswith(('Timeout error:', 'Error:')):
    # Process HTML content - treat as valid HTML unless it's a specific error message
```

## What This Changes
- The code now only treats responses as errors if they start with specific error prefixes like "Timeout error:" or "Error:"
- Valid HTML content that happens to contain the word "error" somewhere in the page will now be properly processed
- Web pages from Wikipedia, Poetry Foundation, Britannica, etc. will be correctly parsed and summarized

## Expected Result
After this fix, Google searches should return properly formatted results with:
- Extracted text summaries (not raw HTML)
- Author information (when available)
- Publication dates (when available)
- Proper error messages only for actual fetch failures

## Testing
To test the fix, you would need to:
1. Ensure all required dependencies are installed (aiohttp, beautifulsoup4, lxml, etc.)
2. Set up Google Custom Search API credentials (CUSTOM_SEARCH_API_KEY and CUSTOM_SEARCH_ID)
3. Run a search query and verify that results contain summaries instead of HTML in error fields

The fix is now deployed in both the main service files and the AWS deployment versions.
