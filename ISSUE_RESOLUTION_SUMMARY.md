# MCP Server Issue Resolution Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. Primary Error
```
TypeError: NoneType takes no arguments
```
This occurred at line 31 in `services/document_service.py` when trying to create a class that inherits from `FPDF`.

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

The diagnostic script revealed that the following critical Python packages were **NOT installed**:

1. **fpdf** (1.7.2) - Required for PDF generation
2. **openai** (>=1.0.0) - Required for AI services
3. **weaviate-client** (>=3.15.0) - Required for vector database
4. **markdown2** (>=2.4.0) - Required for markdown processing
5. **mcp** (>=0.9.0) - Required for MCP server framework
6. **slack-sdk** - Required for Slack integration (was missing from requirements.txt)
7. **semantic-router** - Required for semantic routing (was missing from requirements.txt)

### 3. Import Chain Failure

The error cascade occurred as follows:

1. `config.py` failed to import due to missing `openai` and `semantic_router` packages
2. When `config.py` import failed, the exception handler in `document_service.py` set `FPDF = None`
3. When `MyFPDF` class tried to inherit from `FPDF` (which was None), it caused the TypeError

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `requirements.txt`

Added missing dependencies:
- `semantic-router>=0.0.20`
- `slack-sdk>=3.19.0`

### 2. Updated AWS Deployment Script

Modified `aws-deployment/deploy.sh` to include all required dependencies in the Lambda layer:
- Fixed fpdf version from `>=2.5.0` to `==1.7.2` (matching main requirements)
- Added `slack-sdk>=3.19.0`
- Added `semantic-router>=0.0.20`
- Added `mcp>=0.9.0`
- Added other missing dependencies

### 3. Created Documentation

- **`diagnose_imports.py`** - Diagnostic script to check for import issues
- **`INSTALLATION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- **`ISSUE_RESOLUTION_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document

## Installation Instructions for Your Test Server

To fix the issues on your test server, run the following commands:

```bash
# 1. Update your local repository to get the fixed requirements.txt
git pull

# 2. Install all dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Verify installation (optional)
python3 diagnose_imports.py

# 4. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys

# 5. Run the application
python3 main.py
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always ensure all imports in config.py are listed in requirements.txt**
2. **Use proper error handling to provide clear error messages**
3. **The diagnostic script can help quickly identify missing dependencies**
4. **Keep AWS deployment dependencies synchronized with main requirements**

## Verification

After installing dependencies, the application should start without errors. The warnings about missing configurations (Slack, Odoo, etc.) are expected if those services aren't configured in the `.env` file, but they shouldn't prevent the application from starting.
