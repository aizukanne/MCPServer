# Security Best Practices

This guide outlines the security measures implemented in the MCP Office Assistant Server and provides recommendations for maintaining a secure environment.

## Input Sanitization

All user inputs are sanitized to prevent common security vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.

## File Path Validation

File paths are validated to prevent directory traversal attacks, ensuring that users can only access files within the intended directories.

## Code Execution

Code execution is restricted to safe mathematical operations within a sandboxed environment. This prevents the execution of arbitrary code and limits the potential for abuse.

## External API Calls

All external API calls include robust error handling and validation to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure data integrity.

## Environment Variables

Sensitive information, such as API keys and database credentials, should be stored in a `.env` file and never hard-coded into the source code.
