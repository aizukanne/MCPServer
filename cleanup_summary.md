# Cleanup Summary - Unused Dependencies Removal

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Unused Semantic Router Code

**Files Modified:**
- `config.py` - Removed import and encoder initialization
- `aws-deployment/src/config.py` - Removed import and encoder initialization
- `requirements.txt` - Removed `semantic-router>=0.0.20` and `pydantic>=2.0.0` dependencies
- `pyproject.toml` - Removed `pydantic>=2.0.0` dependency
- `diagnose_imports.py` - Updated to remove semantic_router references

### 2. What Was Removed

**From config files:**
```python
# REMOVED: Import
from semantic_router.encoders import OpenAIEncoder

# REMOVED: Encoder initialization
encoder = OpenAIEncoder(
    os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
)
```

**From requirements.txt and pyproject.toml:**
```
semantic-router>=0.0.20
pydantic>=2.0.0
```

### 3. Why It Was Safe to Remove

- The `encoder` variable was never imported or used by any other file
- No functionality depended on semantic-router
- Pydantic was not imported or used anywhere in the codebase
- Both were leftover/unused dependencies

### 4. Benefits

- ✅ Eliminates the Pydantic deprecation warning completely
- ✅ Reduces dependencies (removed 2 unused packages)
- ✅ Cleaner codebase
- ✅ Faster installation (two fewer packages)

### 5. No Impact On

- All existing functionality remains intact
- No breaking changes
- All services continue to work as before

## Testing

After these changes, the application should:
1. Start without the Pydantic deprecation warning
2. Still show the AWS region fix we implemented earlier
3. Have all the same functionality as before
