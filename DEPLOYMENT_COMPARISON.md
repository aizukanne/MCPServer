# Deployment Options Comparison

## Overview

The MCP Office Assistant supports two deployment architectures, each with distinct advantages.

## 🏠 Local MCP Server vs ☁️ AWS Lambda

| Aspect | Local MCP Server | AWS Lambda |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| **Protocol** | Native MCP over WebSocket | REST API over HTTPS |
| **Scaling** | Single instance | Auto-scaling |
| **Cost** | Server hosting costs | Pay-per-request |
| **Latency** | Very low (local) | Low (network dependent) |
| **Availability** | Depends on server uptime | 99.9% AWS SLA |
| **Setup Complexity** | Simple | Moderate |
| **Multi-Project** | Requires custom routing | Built-in API keys |
| **Maintenance** | Manual updates | Managed infrastructure |

## 🎯 When to Choose Each Option

### Choose Local MCP Server When:
- **Direct MCP Protocol**: Your AI application requires native MCP
- **Low Latency**: Sub-millisecond response times needed
- **Development**: Local testing and development
- **Simple Setup**: Quick start without cloud complexity
- **Private Network**: Tools must stay within private network
- **Custom Protocol**: Need WebSocket or specific MCP features

### Choose AWS Lambda When:
- **Multiple Projects**: Serving multiple teams/applications
- **High Availability**: Need 99.9%+ uptime
- **Auto-Scaling**: Variable or unpredictable load
- **Cost Optimization**: Pay only for actual usage
- **Global Access**: Worldwide API access needed
- **Zero Maintenance**: Prefer managed infrastructure
- **REST API**: Client applications prefer HTTP/REST

## 📊 Performance Comparison

### Local MCP Server
```
Cold Start: None (always running)
Response Time: 10-50ms (local network)
Throughput: Limited by server resources
Concurrent Users: Depends on server capacity
Memory Usage: Full application in memory
```

### AWS Lambda
```
Cold Start: 1-3 seconds (first request)
Response Time: 100-500ms (including network)
Throughput: Virtually unlimited
Concurrent Users: 1000+ concurrent executions
Memory Usage: Per-function optimization
```

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Local MCP Server Costs
- **Server**: $20-100/month (VPS/dedicated)
- **Bandwidth**: Usually included
- **Maintenance**: Developer time
- **Scaling**: Additional servers needed

### AWS Lambda Costs
- **Requests**: $0.20 per 1M requests
- **Compute**: $0.0000166667 per GB-second
- **API Gateway**: $3.50 per 1M API calls
- **Storage**: S3 and DynamoDB usage

### Cost Examples (Monthly)
| Usage Level | Local Server | AWS Lambda |
|-------------|--------------|------------|
| **Light** (1K requests) | $25-50 | $0.50-2 |
| **Medium** (10K requests) | $25-50 | $2-5 |
| **Heavy** (100K requests) | $50-100+ | $10-20 |
| **Enterprise** (1M requests) | $100-500+ | $50-100 |

## 🔧 Feature Comparison

### Both Options Support:
- ✅ All 26 MCP tools
- ✅ Same business logic
- ✅ Identical functionality
- ✅ Security and validation
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Logging and monitoring

### Local MCP Server Exclusive:
- 🔌 Native MCP protocol
- ⚡ WebSocket connections
- 🏠 Local file system access
- 🔐 Network isolation
- 🛠️ Direct debugging

### AWS Lambda Exclusive:
- 🔑 Built-in API key management
- 🌍 Global edge locations
- 📊 CloudWatch integration
- 🔄 Auto-scaling
- 💾 Managed database integration
- 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code

## 🚀 Migration Path

### From Local to AWS
1. **Test AWS deployment** alongside local
2. **Update client applications** to use REST API
3. **Migrate data** to AWS services (S3, DynamoDB)
4. **Switch DNS/endpoints** to AWS
5. **Decommission** local server

### From AWS to Local
1. **Deploy local MCP server**
2. **Export data** from AWS services
3. **Update client applications** to use MCP protocol
4. **Test thoroughly** in local environment
5. **Clean up** AWS resources

## 🎛️ Hybrid Approach

You can run both simultaneously:

```
Development → Local MCP Server (fast iteration)
Staging → AWS Lambda (production-like testing)
Production → AWS Lambda (high availability)
```

Or use different options for different use cases:

```
Internal Tools → Local MCP Server
Customer-Facing → AWS Lambda
```

## 📋 Decision Matrix

Rate each factor from 1-5 based on your needs:

| Factor | Weight | Local Score | AWS Score |
|--------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Cost Sensitivity** | ___ | 3 | 5 |
| **Setup Simplicity** | ___ | 5 | 3 |
| **Scalability Needs** | ___ | 2 | 5 |
| **Latency Requirements** | ___ | 5 | 4 |
| **Availability Needs** | ___ | 3 | 5 |
| **Multi-Project Support** | ___ | 2 | 5 |
| **Maintenance Preference** | ___ | 2 | 5 |

**Calculate**: (Weight × Score) for each option and compare totals.

## 🎯 Recommendation

### For Most Users: **AWS Lambda**
- Better long-term value
- Easier multi-project support
- Higher reliability
- Lower maintenance overhead

### For Specific Cases: **Local MCP Server**
- Need native MCP protocol
- Extremely latency-sensitive
- Private network requirements
- Simple single-user setup

### For Enterprises: **Both**
- Local for development
- AWS for production
- Best of both worlds

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Assess your requirements** using the decision matrix
2. **Start with local development** to test functionality
3. **Deploy AWS version** for production scaling
4. **Monitor costs and performance** to optimize
5. **Consider hybrid approach** for complex needs
