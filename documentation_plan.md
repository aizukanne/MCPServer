# Documentation Plan for MCP Office Assistant Server

This document outlines the plan for creating comprehensive documentation for the MCP Office Assistant Server.

## 1. Project Goal

To create a well-structured, comprehensive, and easy-to-navigate documentation set for the MCP Office Assistant Server. The documentation will be located in the `docs` directory and will be written in Markdown.

## 2. Documentation Structure

The documentation will be organized into the following sections:

-   **Home:** A central landing page that provides a project overview, key features, and navigation to other sections.
-   **Getting Started:** A step-by-step guide for setting up the project, including prerequisites, installation, and configuration.
-   **Guides:** In-depth tutorials and explanations for advanced topics, such as adding new tools, security best practices, and deployment strategies.
-   **API Reference:** Detailed documentation for all available tools, including parameters, examples, and error handling.
-   **Troubleshooting:** A collection of common issues and their solutions to help users resolve problems quickly.
-   **Contributing:** Guidelines for contributing to the project, including how to report bugs, suggest features, and submit pull requests.

## 3. File Structure

The final file structure for the documentation will be as follows:

```
