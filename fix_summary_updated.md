# MCP Server Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Odoo Configuration Warning
**Problem**: "Odoo configuration or URL shortener not available"
**Cause**: `base_url` variable was not defined in config.py
**Fix**: Added `base_url = os.getenv('ODOO_BASE_URL')` to load from environment

### 2. Server Context Manager Error  
**Problem**: "'Server' object does not support the asynchronous context manager protocol"
**Cause**: Incorrect usage of `async with self.server:` in main.py
**Fix**: Changed to direct call `await self.server.run()`

### 3. Weaviate Connection Leaks
**Problem**: "The connection to Weaviate was not closed properly"
**Cause**: Weaviate client created at module import time and never closed
**Fix**: 
- Added proper initialization and cleanup functions
- Added cleanup in main.py's finally block
- Kept backward compatibility by maintaining `weaviate_client` variable

### 4. MCP Server Run Arguments Error
**Problem**: "Server.run() missing 3 required positional arguments: 'read_stream', 'write_stream', and 'initialization_options'"
**Cause**: MCP Server requires stdio streams for communication
**Fix**: Updated server.run() call to include required arguments:
```python
await self.server.run(
    read_stream=sys.stdin.buffer,
    write_stream=sys.stdout.buffer,
    initialization_options=options
)
```

## Implementation Details

### config.py Changes
```python
# Added logging import
import logging

# Added base_url from environment
base_url = os.getenv('ODOO_BASE_URL')

# Changed Weaviate initialization to be conditional
weaviate_client = None

def init_weaviate_client():
    """Initialize the Weaviate client if credentials are available."""
    global weaviate_client
    if weaviate_client is None and weaviate_url and weaviate_api_key:
        try:
            weaviate_client = weaviate.connect_to_weaviate_cloud(
                cluster_url=weaviate_url,
                auth_credentials=Auth.api_key(weaviate_api_key),
                headers=headers
            )
            logging.info("Weaviate client initialized successfully")
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Failed to connect to Weaviate: {e}")
            weaviate_client = None
    return weaviate_client

# Try to initialize on module load if credentials are available
if weaviate_url and weaviate_api_key:
    init_weaviate_client()

def close_weaviate_client():
    """Close the Weaviate client connection if it exists."""
    global weaviate_client
    if weaviate_client:
        try:
            weaviate_client.close()
            logging.info("Weaviate client closed successfully")
        except Exception as e:
            logging.warning(f"Error closing Weaviate client: {e}")
        finally:
            weaviate_client = None
```

### main.py Changes
```python
# Removed async context manager and added stdio streams
async def run(self) -> None:
    """Run the MCP server."""
    logger.info("Starting Office Assistant MCP Server...")
    
    # Initialize server options
    options = InitializationOptions(
        server_name="office-assistant",
        server_version="1.0.0",
        capabilities={
            "tools": {}
        }
    )
    
    # Run the server with stdio streams
    await self.server.run(
        read_stream=sys.stdin.buffer,
        write_stream=sys.stdout.buffer,
        initialization_options=options
    )

# Added cleanup in main function
async def main() -> None:
    """Main entry point."""
    try:
        server = OfficeAssistantServer()
        await server.run()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        logger.info("Server stopped by user")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Server error: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)
    finally:
        # Clean up Weaviate connection
        try:
            from config import close_weaviate_client
            close_weaviate_client()
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"Error during cleanup: {e}")
```

## Testing

A test script `test_fixes.py` was created to verify:
1. Config imports successfully
2. All required variables and functions exist
3. Services can be imported
4. Weaviate cleanup works properly

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure your `.env` file includes:
```
WEAVIATE_API_KEY=your-weaviate-api-key
WEAVIATE_URL=https://your-cluster.weaviate.network
ODOO_BASE_URL=https://your-odoo-base-url
```

## Updated Commit Message

```
fix: resolve server startup issues and resource leaks

- Add base_url loading from ODOO_BASE_URL environment variable
- Fix async context manager error by removing unsupported 'async with' usage
- Implement conditional Weaviate client initialization with proper cleanup
- Add cleanup for Weaviate connections on server shutdown
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing code using weaviate_client
- Add logging import to config.py for better error handling
- Fix MCP server run() call to include required stdio streams

Fixes issues with:
